The reed queen hypothesis suggests that living organisms evolve to maintain themselves in the same conditions.

Currently humanity is in an arm race against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that caused the death of millions by Covid-19.
In this race, regulating our mobility, using face masks and vaccination have been key in controlling the daily increase of Covid-19 cases. However restricting mobility has costs on household economy and wellbeing. 

Here, I present a set of algorithms aimed at analysing Covid-19 cases and mobility time series, to find the mobility events in the past that explains the increase in daily cases of Covid within a time interval.
